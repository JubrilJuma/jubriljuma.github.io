<div class="preview-title">BlockPanda</div>
<p>BlockPanda helps developers build and deploy apps on a distributed ledger (blockchain), without having to worry about building the underlying framework. This is an ongoing project, so there is not much to report just yet.</p>


<div class="preview-title">Verifi</div>
<p>Verifi allows firms/individuals make better decisions using data from a multiple sources (think Social Security number + Credit Rating firm). Initially a single product, we had to split this product into 3 due to different target users. The new products are Assure (educational/work history verification), Pay (payroll management/pay-work history verification) and Inform (API to report/request human data).</p>
<div class="project-text-title">Results</div>

<div class="preview-title">Sangalo</div>
<p>Sangalo connects football fans to communities of football fans. Think a football game at the pub. At the time, about 73% of football fans in Nigeria were low income to unemployed young men between the ages of 15-35. I led this startup for 17 months.</p>
<p>The product had been in development for 11 months receiving moderate traction (e.g. 1,500 organic users) prior to my team taking over, and was engaging with the users across a mobile website/iphone-Android mobile app. Development costs were high with the development team not been fast enough to respond to design pivots based on user feedback, amongst other issues.</p>

<div class="preview-title">4Forty Bus Limited/Oya.com.ng</div>
<p>Oya.com.ng is an online interstate bus ticketing service, allowing you buy tickets from any transporter anytime any day. This started out as a school final year project and ended up gaining traction amongst users that it got acquired by <a href="www.oya.com.ng" target="_blank">Wakanow.com</a>  as they expanded their travel ticketing services to include bus ticketing. Our team of five was composed of one developer, one admin responsible and three sales people. I was leading the sales team, however, when we could not handle the user feedback we were getting from all stakeholders I decided to fill in the role of the product manager/designer and learn literally on the job.</p>
