					<div class="project-text">ADPay is a deep impression service allowing advertisers pay for only for completed impressions, publishers (ad hosts)to increase revenue by accepting ad revenue as a payment for their user focused services, and end users (consumers) being able to enjoy full service benefits in exchange for a completed ad impression</div>

					<div class="project-text-title">Problem</div>
					<div class="project-text">Local mum and pop shops -the really tiny kiosks- and supermarkets had been complaining about the ineffectiveness of digital advertising, rather prefering to print flyers and play extremely loud music in front of their entrances to attract customers. The real problem was not the ineffectiveness really,but the lack of the knowledge or skills to run a targetted digital campaign and also the increasing costs associated with getting proper help.</div>
					<div class="col-md-12">
					<img src="images/adpay/tom.gif" class="img-responsive image-mb image-mt">
				</div>
					<div class="project-text">I will be honest, designing an ad platform was challenging, and for all the uncommon reasons. There are existing solutions that do not seem to be taking care of this niche market, juggled with the fact that not all the target users are 100 percent technology savvy. Which user do we prioritise here- the advertiser, publisher or end user?</div>
				</div>

				<div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
					<div class="project-text-title">Data, no guesswork please!</div>
					<div class="project-text">Well, after a heated debate within the sprint team, we decided to test our hypothesis by following the Google Ventures design sprint because its more rigid design process would allow us to ship an MVP fast (we were behind schedule with the investor).</div>
				</div>

				</div>
				<div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
					<div class="project-text-title">3 Users. 3 Experiences. </div>
					<div class="project-text">Finally, we had a direction (after a couple of insightful sprint tests) and were going to focus on the advertisers who were also more techy savvy and were in real pain. We also knew how long ads should run for to be considered effective by local consumers, and we knew how best to satisfy the 3 users. The channel would be a website, with separate logins for the publishers and advertisers. End users would continue with their usual habits not knowing anything had changed, except now, when they want to exit a service on a payment page they would see an option to watch an ad in exchange for full fulfiment (well, with a couple of T&Cs to avoid misuse). This ended up being one of the fastest projects I have ever completed and shipped to the client.</div>
