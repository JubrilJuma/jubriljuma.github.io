					<div class="project-title">I Believe In An Experience At A Time</div>
					
					<div class="project-text">I am a big believer in great experiences. I believe that great experiences make us come back for more, most times even without realizing it. From the way that cool, refreshing drink rolls down your throat on a parched afternoon to the way that homely playful ad replays on your mind, these experiences have been carefully crafted to elicit an intended response from a user: happiness. </div>
				</div>

				<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
					
					<div class="project-text">This is why I got into design (actually, I got in by accident but stayed because of this). I have been inspired by simple experiences given in products and services that have left the customers in awe. It is amusing to see a customer use a product and not know why they use it, even though it may be slightly inferior to similar products in features, yet the customer is happy with it all the same. Or when you see people who have used an analog system for years all of a sudden switch to a new technology with next to zero friction and not know why they ever thought this new method would have been more difficult to use. These little moments of user satisfaction are why I love user design centric thinking.</div>
					
					<div class="project-text">I believe in being free to live where you want, or do what you want. I also believe in the 80:20 principle, especially when it comes to design and all the other processes that have to happen to enable a designer work. As a designer, I know that 80% of my results come from the 20% design work I actually do. The remaining 80% of the work I do is necessary but are not necessarily related to my core function e.g. operations meetings, trainings etc. This is what led me on this quest to become more effective while focusing on how best to add value as a designer.</div>
				</div>

				<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
					<div class="project-text">For me, Toptal is the best platform to do this. It has the combination of remote work, client management and a community of the top 3% to sharpen your skills against. Joining the Toptal UX Designers would really be a milestone towards building better experiences, especially for users in Africa.</div>
				
				
					<div class="project-text">Oh, and I think you need me to help with some of the minor onboarding processes that were slightly frustrating.</div>
