					<div class="project-text-title">Overview</div>
					<div class="project-text"><p>The cost of business is ridiculously high in developing countries, with Nigeria being one of them. There is no data (or large silos of data buried in bureaucracy) to verify the identities or activities of the individuals or firms you are doing business with and this risk is passed on to the customers as a financial cost. It is really a vicious cycle that the citizens of the country have grown used to and adapted their behaviours to e.g. 97% of e-commerce is fulfilled with Pay-on-Delivery rather than paying online with bank cards, and bank business loans are given at a fixed 30% rate. Verifi tries to solve this high cost of commerce problem by pulling data from numerous sources to create more complete data backed profiles for individuals, allowing individuals and firms make better transactional decisions e.g. flexible interest rate on loans based on credit score.</p>
<p>Verifi was an interesting project, were once again I was part of the team of guys cleaning up product design flaws in a new struggling product(from product-market fit to design). What started out as one project ended up being three...</p></div>

						<div class="project-text-title">Process</div>
						<div class="project-text"><p>This was a product built without any design guidelines or philosophy, based simply on the opinion of the highest paid person. This meant that the entire team did not understand the role of design in the product development cycle. Version one of the product had low traction numbers despite positive interest from friends, family and a small focus group from the CEO. This was because it had been built without following any design principles and it solved the problem for only one user- the product owner/CEO.</p>
<p>When we joined the team, we explained our philosophy and tried to get a buy-in from the entire team. We also trained the rest of the team (sales and developers) on the iterative design approach. Furthermore, we decided to immediately start user research and tests with the live product at each stage of the development cycle (design, build and launch) e.g. we shadowed the customers and sales team to get qualitative feedback and started tracking engagement metrics. Using the data we were receiving, we were able to tell what the next iterations were going to be and pivot the product to solve real user needs.</p></div>
