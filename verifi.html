					<div class="project-text-title">Overview</div>
					<div class="project-text"><p>Pay by Verifi is a payroll application to allow HR/Accountants manage their payrolls and automate their salary payments.</p>
<p>HRs of small-medium businesses hate the on-boarding process for their staff whenever they switch payroll SaaS. Also, accountants wasted time completing payroll runs each month with because too many bottlenecks within the process. For example, 80% of small business accountants were sending exported Excel sheets from their payroll applications attached to an authorisation letter to their banks to complete payroll runs.</p>
<p>The product goal was to solve these user problems while providing the standard payroll experience.</p></div>

						<div class="project-text"><p>
For the HRs, we interviewed a set of HRs and found that most payroll applications required them to export an Excel file, fill in the data according to a certain data structure and then re-upload this file. Most HRs either did not have all the data fields, had the data as a physical copy or found the process of copying and pasting data lines tedious.</p>
<p>After some brainstorming,my team and I decided to run the following A/B test.</p>
<p>For the HRs, we decided to test;
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
  <li>A test: HRs bulk uploading employee records</li>
  <li>B test: HRs sending an invite to employees to complete personal details</li>
  </ul></p>
<p>The process completion rates were higher for B test and so we moved forward with it and refined this iteration further.</p></div>

<div class="project-text">
<p>For the accountants, the numerous fraud checks and regulatory agencies had added many inefficiencies to the process of company to employee fund transfer (a monthly task). For example, after sending the payroll file and authorisation letter to the bank, accountants had to still call the account officers at the bank to speed up.</p>
<p>Though we were limited by the Central Bank's rules on bank transactions, by shadowing the stakeholders involved in the process we were able to observe loop holes that we could capitalise on. This process showed us that even though the process of connecting company accounts to the payroll was tedious, there was a less complicated workaround- using comapny bank cards!</p>
<p>To reduce the length of the process, we built an MVP that allowed accountants request for bank cards, add bank cards and raise their transfer limits without ever leaving their seats. And this was a one time activity. While not perfect, this allowed accountants to cutout the bank officers every month they wanted to run payroll.</p></div>
