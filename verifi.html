						<div class="project-text">I have always liked simplyfing complex topics, so when I was tasked with joining the Verifi team to help with the user experience design I jumped at it. Verifi wants to be the trust guarantor, helping people make smarter decisions when dealing with other people, especially in financial decisions. So there in lay the problem: who were the users and what were their needs/did they really have a problem? Initially, there were only 2 identified users. We quickly discovered that this product had 4 broad user groups with sub user groups within them, and the previous user bundling was extremely confusing for the each end user. We separated the inital bundle into three core user problems. This also allowed us to be more user centric because each service had its own target users with very different experiences e.g. with Pay by Verifi (payroll) we learnt that staff of small businesses were more likely to have phone numbers than emails, so we redesigned our "Company HR Invitation" email to also include an SMS acquisition flow. This was one of many ways we had to redesign by simplifying the complexities of offering financial services while sourcing for useful data points and reporting these data points to more end users.</div>
