					<div class="project-text-title">Overview</div>
					<div class="project-text"><p>Pay by Verifi is a payroll application to allow HR/Accountants manage their payrolls and automate their salary payments.</p>
<p>Most payroll solutions focus on managing HR activities and less on easing the onboarding of employees or the accounting processes. For example, 80% of small business accountants were sending exported Excel sheets from their payroll applications attached to an authorisation letter to their banks to complete payroll runs.</p>
<p>The product goal was to solve these user problems while providing the standard payroll experience.</p></div>

						<div class="project-text-title">Process</div>
						<div class="project-text"><p>To achieve this, we ran surveys and had customer interviews to understand how users were currently solving the problems of onboarding and managing the bank. The results showed that HRs would rather stay with an older/less functional app than switch because of the extra work involved with (re)onboarding employees, while accountants had to call their account officers at the bank to speed up payrolls (even after sending the payroll and authorisation letter via email).</p>
<p>After some brainstorming,my team and I came up with 2 concepts on how best to solve each these problems.</p>
<p>For the HRs, we decided to test;
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
  <li>HRs bulk uploading employee records</li>
  <li>HRs sending an email invite to employees to complete personal details</li>
  <li>HRs sending a phone invite to employees to complete personal details</li>
  <li>HRs sending both phone and email invite to employees to complete personal details</li>
</ul></p>
<p>The process completion rates were higher for fourth option and so we moved forward with it and refined the process further.</p></div>

<div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
<div class="project-text"><p>For the accountants, we were limited by the Central Bank's rules on bank transactions. We came up with a couple of hypotheses, and to test them we had to shadow the users all through to observe bottlenecks and loop holes that we could capitalise on. This process showed us that even though the process of connecting company accounts to the payroll was tedious, there was a less complicated workaround- using comapny bank cards!</p>
<p>To reduce the length of the process, we built an MVP that allowed accountants request for bank cards, add bank cards and raise their transfer limits without ever leaving their seats. And this was a one time activity. While not perfect, this allowed accountants to cutout the bank officers every month they wanted to run payroll.</p></div>
